#Introduction

Around July of 2004 David Heinemeier Hansson publicly release the Ruby on Rails framework, that had been extracted from a software called Basecamp. More than three years later, on the 7th of december 2007 Ruby on Rails got into its 2.0 version with many important changes.

Six months has passed since that time, and during this time more than **1400 developers** from all around the world contributed **1600 patches**. And today, 1st of June 2008, Ruby on Rails gets to its 2.1 version.

According to David the major new features are:

* Timezones
* Dirty tracking
* Gem Dependencies
* Named scope
* UTC-based migrations
* Better caching

As always, to update or install the new version:

	gem install rails
